                           SATK - Stand-alone Tool Kit

Copyright (C) 2012-2016, 2020 Harold Grovesteen                     

SATK is intended to assist in the development of stand-alone, or baremetal,
programs on mainframe compatible systems.  While targeting the Hercules
emulator, nothing precludes its use with "big-iron" real or virtual
environments.

Getting Started:
    Use the "Download ZIP" button on this page to download the current
    repository contents.  By "unzipping" the downloaded file into your file
    system, the package is installed on your system.  (By deleting the SATK
    directory and its contents the package is uninstalled.)

    Then follow the directions in the file SATK/doc/asma/ASMA.pdf,
    "Getting Started" section, for additional steps required to prepare
    your system for use of A Small Mainframe Assembler and other SATK
    tools.

The following directories are provided:
    asma            - A Small Mainframe Assembler (ASMA) for stand-alone
                      programs.  ASMA runs wherever Python 3.3 runs!
    doc             - Various related documentation.
    doc/asma        - ASMA related documentation
    doc/iplelf      - Documentation related to the IPL ELF Supplement and SATK 
                      support.
    lib             - GNU ld linker scripts
    samples         - Various IPL related samples
    samples/asma    - Sample programs using ASMA
    src             - source code for use in stand-alone programs.
    src/drivers     - Device drivers - very experimental, do not recommend use
    src/hal         - Hardware Abstraction Layer
    src/ipl         - IPL ELF supporting source
    src/ipl/include - Routines useful for IPL ELF stage0 loaders.
    src/storage     - Storage management functions.  Only static assignment 
                      supported.
    srcasm          - Bare-metal facilities using ASMA.
    tools           - Python and bash tools for use with SATK.
                         asma.py - command-line interface to ASMA
                         codepage.py - ASMA code page customization
                         config.py - local tool configuration management and testing
                         fp.py - floating point utility
                         hopcodes.py - Hercules instruction audit tool
                         msl.py - Machine Specification Language (MSL) processor
                         mslrpt.py - MSL architecture comparison report
                         xmi.py - XMI file format PDS and member utility
    tools/herc      - Hercules emulator specific tools
    tools/ipl       - IPL ELF Media Preparation Processor, iplmed.py, and 
                      related tools: ipldpp.py, media.py
    xforth          - Forth language cross-compiler framework
